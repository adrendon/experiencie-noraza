		<p>Some of the fleet used to distribute costa products to stores are duel fuel, low emmision vehicles. These lorries use biogas reclaimed from a process using our food waste.</p>
		<p>To reduce environmental impact, many of our delivery lorries also pick up the used coffee grounds that go on to be used in alternate energy sources.</p>
