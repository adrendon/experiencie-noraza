		<p>Then we slow roast our coffee beans to extract the true coffee flavour and aroma. Just as we have done since 1971. Every batch is roasted at low temperatures in a Petroncini and Probat drum roaster - the best available naturally. We stop the roast just at the point when the oils are still contained within the bean.</p>
