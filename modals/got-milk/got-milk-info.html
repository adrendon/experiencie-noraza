		<h2>Buying British</h2>

		<p>We know our customers want to support British farmers and trust their quality and welfare standards; thus, all Costa’s poultry, pork and beef products are from British farms. This is clearly labelled on all Costa packaging.</p>
		<p>As a result of our ongoing discussions with our partners, we have moved to a different way of calculating prices payable to our farmers. Collectively, we have agreed a new payment system, which measures both a basket of market prices and the cost of production per litre. Our partners are very supportive of the move and believe it to be a fair way of working. </p>
