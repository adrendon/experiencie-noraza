		<h2>Itâ€™s the little things that count</h2>
		<p>Our paper cup comes from card made of sustainable wood pulp from forests in northern Europe. The cup uses a thermal cover made of recycled content and the lid is 100% recyclable. Even with the tiny amount of PET plastic used to line the cardboard and create a watertight seal, the cup can be recycled in the UK in certain areas where access to suitable recycling facilities exists.</p>
