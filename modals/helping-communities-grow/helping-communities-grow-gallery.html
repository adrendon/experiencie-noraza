		<p>The Costa Foundation first became aware of Adame Yirgachefe 2nd Cycle School in January 2011. The school was in a dreadful state with up to 90 children crammed in a classroom and the structure being very poor.</p>
		<p>After a lot of hard work, the new school opened in October 2011 and has been wonderfully received by the children, parents and teachers. <a href="//www.costafoundation.com/adame-yirgachefe/</" target="_blank">Read the case study at the Costa Foundation website.</a></p>
